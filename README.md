# CoreNEURON
> Optimised simulator engine for [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)

CoreNEURON is a simplified engine for the [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) simulator optimised for both memory usage and computational speed. Its goal is to simulate massive cell networks with minimal memory footprint and optimal performance.

# Features

CoreNEURON supports the following subset of features provided by [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/):
* FixedStep method
* Todo

# Requirements
* [CMake 2.8.12+](https://cmake.org)
* [MOD2C](http://github.com/BlueBrain/mod2c)
* [MPI 2.0+](http://mpich.org)


# Installation

First, install mod2c using the instructions provided [here](http://github.com/BlueBrain/mod2c). Make sure to install mod2c and CoreNEURON in the same installation directory (using CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX).

Set the appropriate MPI wrappers for the C and C++ compilers, e.g.:

```bash
export CC=mpicc
export CXX=mpicxx
```

The workflow for building CoreNEURON is slightly different from that of NEURON, especially considering the use of **nrnivmodl**. Currently we do not provide **nrnivmodl** for CoreNEURON and hence the user needs to provide paths of mod file directories (semicolon separated) at the time of the build process using the *ADDITIONAL_MECHPATH* variable:

```bash
cd CoreNeuron
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DADDITIONAL_MECHPATH="/path/of/folder/with/mod/file1dir;/path/of/folder/with/mod/file2dir" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/isntall/directory
make
make install
```

If you are building CoreNeuron with Neurodamus, you have to set *ADDITIONAL_MECHPATH* and *ADDITIONAL_MECHS* as:
```bash
cmake .. -DADDITIONAL_MECHPATH="/path/of/neurodamus/lib/modlib" -DADDITIONAL_MECHS="/path/of/neurodamus/lib/modlib/coreneuron_modlist.txt"
```
Make sure to switch to appropriate branch of Neurodamus (based on your dataset).

On a Cray system the user has to provide the path to the MPI library as follows:
```bash
export CC=`which cc`
export CXX=`which CC`
cmake -DMPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH=$MPICH_DIR/include -DMPI_C_LIBRARIES=$MPICH_DIR/lib
```

We have tested the build process on the following platforms:

* Blue Gene/Q: XLC/GCC
* x86: Intel, PGI, GCC, Cray
* OSX: Clang


# Optimization Flags

* One can specify C/C++ optimization flags spcecific to the compiler and architecture with -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS options to the CMake command. For example, on a BG-Q:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -qtune=qp -qarch=qp -q64 -qhot=simd -qsmp -qthreaded" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O3 -qtune=qp -qarch=qp -q64 -qhot=simd -qsmp -qthreaded"
```

* By default OpenMP threading is enabled. You can disable it with -DCORENEURON_OPENMP=OFF
* By default CoreNEURON (And NEURON) uses the AoS (Array of Structs) memory layout for all data structures. For efficient memory access and vectorization you can use the SoA (Struct of Array) layout by adding "-DLAYOUT=0" to the C/C++ compiler flags (0 = SoA and 1 = AoS).
* If the default compiler flags are not supported, try -DCMAKE_BUILD_TARGET=SOME_TARGET


# RUNNING SIMULATION:

Note that the CoreNEURON simulator dependends on NEURON to build the network model: see [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) documentation for more information. Once you build the model using NEURON, you can launch CoreNEURON on the same or different machine by:
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8     #set appropriate value

mpiexec -np 2 /path/to/isntall/directory/coreneuron_exec -e 10 -d /path/to/model/built/by/neuron -mpi
```
See below for information on the different input flags.

In order to see the command line options, you can use:

/path/to/isntall/directory/coreneuron_exec --help

```bash
       -s TIME, \--tstart=TIME
              Set the start time to TIME (double). The default value is '0.'
       -e TIME, \--tstop=TIME
              Set the stop time to TIME (double). The default value is '100.'
       -t TIME, \--dt=TIME
              Set the dt time to TIME (double). The default value is '0.025'.
       -l NUMBER, --celsius=NUMBER
              Set the celsius temperature to NUMBER (double). The default value is '34.'.
       -p FILE, \--pattern=FILE
              Apply patternstim with the spike file FILE (char*). The default value is 'NULL'.
       -b SIZE, \--spikebuf=SIZE
              Set the spike buffer to be of the size SIZE (int). The default value is '100000'.
       -g NUMBER, \--prcellgid=NUMBER
              Output prcellstate information for the gid NUMBER (int). The default value is '-1'.
       -d PATH, \--datpath=PATH
              Set the path to PATH (char*) containing data generated by NEURON. The default value is '.'.
       -f FILE, \--filesdat=FILE
              Absolute path with the name for the required file FILE (char*). The default value is 'files.dat'.
       -o PATH, --outpath=PATH
              Set the path for the output data to PATH (char*). The default value is '.'.
       -k TIME, --forwardskip=TIME
              Set forwardskip to TIME (double). The default value is '0.'.
       -mpi
              Enable MPI. In order to initialize MPI environment this argument must be specified.
```

# Results

Currently CoreNEURON only outputs spike data. When running the simulation, each MPI rank writes spike information
into a file `out.#mpi_rank`. These files should be combined and sorted to compare with NEURON spike output.
