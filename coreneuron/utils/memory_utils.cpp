/**
 * @file memory_utils.cpp
 * @date 25th Oct 2014
 *
 * @brief Provides functionality to report current memory usage
 * of the simulator using interface provided by malloc.h
 *
 * Memory utilisation report is based on the use of mallinfo
 * interface defined in malloc.h. For 64 bit platform, this
 * is not portable and hence it will be replaced with new
 * glibc implementation of malloc_info.
 *
 * @see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc_info.3.html
