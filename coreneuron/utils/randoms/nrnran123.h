/* interface to Random123 */
/* http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf */

/*
The 4x32 generators utilize a uint32x4 counter and uint32x4 key to transform
into an almost cryptographic quality uint32x4 random result.
There are many possibilites for balancing the sharing of the internal
state instances while reserving a uint32 counter for the stream sequence
and reserving other portions of the counter vector for stream identifiers
and global index used by all streams.

We currently provide a single instance by default in which the policy is
to use the 0th counter uint32 as the stream sequence, words 2 and 3 as the
stream identifier, and word 0 of the key as the global index. Unused words
are constant uint32 0.

It is also possible to use Random123 directly without reference to this
interface. See Random123-1.02/docs/html/index.html
of the full distribution available from
http://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html
