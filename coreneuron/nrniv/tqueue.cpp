/*
 *  The following code implements the basic operations on
 *  an event-set or priority-queue implemented using splay trees:
 *
Hines changed to void spinit(SPTREE**) for use with TQueue.
 *  SPTREE *spinit( compare )	Make a new tree
 *  SPBLK *spenq( n, q )	Insert n in q after all equal keys.
 *  SPBLK *spdeq( np )		Return first key under *np, removing it.
 *  void splay( n, q )		n (already in q) becomes the root.
 *  int n = sphead( q )         n is the head item in q (not removed).
 *  spdelete( n, q )		n is removed from q.
 *
 *  In the above, n points to an SPBLK type, while q points to an
 *  SPTREE.
 *
 *  The implementation used here is based on the implementation
 *  which was used in the tests of splay trees reported in:
 *
 *    An Empirical Comparison of Priority-Queue and Event-Set Implementations,
 *	by Douglas W. Jones, Comm. ACM 29, 4 (Apr. 1986) 300-311.
 *
 *  The changes made include the addition of the enqprior
 *  operation and the addition of up-links to allow for the splay
 *  operation.  The basic splay tree algorithms were originally
 *  presented in:
 *
 *	Self Adjusting Binary Trees,
 *		by D. D. Sleator and R. E. Tarjan,
 *			Proc. ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory
 *			of Computing (Boston, Apr 1983) 235-245.
 *
 *  The enq and enqprior routines use variations on the
 *  top-down splay operation, while the splay routine is bottom-up.
 *  All are coded for speed.
 *
 *  Written by:
 *    Douglas W. Jones
 *
 *  Translated to C by:
 *    David Brower, daveb@rtech.uucp
 *
 * Thu Oct  6 12:11:33 PDT 1988 (daveb) Fixed spdeq, which was broken
 *	handling one-node trees.  I botched the pascal translation of
 *	a VAR parameter.
